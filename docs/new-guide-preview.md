# Japanese Guide

## 1.1 Why people give up on learning Japanese

Many folks have simple goals in mind when learning Japanese: to enjoy untranslated Japanese content and to speak Japanese fluently. Many also fail to reach these goals even after years of study. It's not always their fault though, but rather the method's. In language learning, the method behind your learning makes a huge difference in the progress you make.

As it turns out, reaching such goals is not possible with "traditional" methods of Japanese learning. Many students are led to failure for not including a crucial ingredient to their study routines, and that would be **immersion**—listening to or reading native content made for native speakers. For example, anime is originally broadcasted in Japanese without subtitles, so when consumed in this form, we call it immersion.   

## 1.2 Problems with traditional methods

A Japanese language student following a “traditional” curriculum would usually go through the following steps:

- Learning the alphabet(s);
- Learning basic sentences such as greetings and self-introductions;
- Learning basic grammar structure and vocabulary;
- Coming up with sentences either by having conversations with a tutor or study partner, or by writing;
- Translating example sentences from their native language to their target language and vice versa;   
- Looking up further material about grammar structures and vocabulary in textbooks or YouTube videos recommended by a tutor;
- Accumulating more vocabulary and grammar structures, which becomes a measure of one’s own progress;
- And finally, in the endgame, moving to or visiting Japan in hopes of having opportunities to practice their skills.

None of that is bad in itself, it actually might be sufficient study, but it's not enough to get you to a high level of proficiency. The problem is that they aren't actually engaging with the real language—but what do I mean by that?

Let's take swimming as an example. It's unwise to stay in the baby pool, wearing floaters, taking your sweet time to become a pro at the baby pool before attempting to dip your toes in the kids’ pool. This won’t make you a good swimmer, unless you’re 4 years old.

How about a more relatable example: competitive video games. No one gets better at a game just by playing against the AI and grinding in training mode, no matter for how long. It's essential to play against other humans, even when you think you’re going to lose by a landslide, because that's where the real game is. That's the only possible path to learn.

<strong><h3> It's important to learn how to move on!</h3></strong>

A common trap students fall into in language learning is staying on beginner resources for too long. They want to ensure they know every single detail of their basics and refuse to move onto the real language. They won't engage in anything they aren't already comfortable with, because they are too afraid of not understanding anything. They feel like they aren't “ready". Yet it’s important to leave your beginner resources as soon as possible because, in reality, you will never be ready until you actually start engaging with the real language and get yourself used to it.

## 1.3 The scale of language

Language is… huge. There’s so much to it that far exceeds the limitations of a classroom or app-based approach that tries to teach in a "x means y" or "x does y" format. Learning a language to a high level requires an enormous amount of experience hearing and reading what native speakers say.

It’s often difficult to grasp why they sometimes use that phrase in this context, or this word here instead of that other one… This sets a challenge for us learners as we can't just study grammar and vocabulary to learn how to speak like natives.

Attempting to construct sentences in said target language without the required experience often leads to unnatural, or easily misunderstood phrasing. Lack of experience with how native speakers play with their language will make it difficult to understand them, due to unfamiliarity with sentences outside of a learning resource’s scope.

This is why in your learning routine, **you must “immerse” yourself in the language—read and listen to what natives write and speak.**

Language learning is a process of subconsciously memorizing patterns by the way of comprehensible input. What this means is, when you understand something (=comprehensible) in your immersion (=input), your brain subconsciously stores that pattern for later information retrieval. You see, being able to comfortably read this guide is only possible because you've had so much experience reading English before that, while reading this, your brain goes: "Oh, there's pattern #234 used with pattern #82 and pattern #10!"

And since you are a proficient English reader, this is an effortless process. You've already seen the same patterns elsewhere. You can detect the tone and degree of formality in my writing all thanks to your brain also storing context and other information on the patterns you come across.

Notice how I haven't mentioned "knowing the grammar" or "having memorized the vocabulary"? That's because you don't organically process language in this manner. Some readers may not even be native speakers and probably have studied English grammar in a traditional manner before, but it's unlikely they're actively thinking about it when coming into contact with English every day.

## 1.5 Coming to terms with sucking 

In language learning, and in anything that requires skill, you are always going to start off struggling for a long time until you get better. The reason I say this is, many learners (I am guilty of this too) fall into the trap of attempting to master something before ever trying to engage in practice with what they need to work on. For example, a student might fuss over a certain aspect of grammar for way too long and never find the time to move onto something else they should be spending their time with.

**☝ THIS HERE**, ladies and gentlemen, is what we want to avoid. We have to get into the habit of letting go of time-wasters and start engaging with our object of study.

Yes, you won't understand that book or anime perfectly the first time, but that’s not how learning works. It always takes a third, fourth, fifth and even sixth attempt to finally grasp something.

## 1.6 How you will be studying with this method

The methodology covered in this guide consists of an immersion-based approach supplemented by study.

Your long-term study consists of:  

-    Learning vocabulary;
-    Learning grammar structures;
-    Looking up vocabulary and grammar found in immersion;
-    Using flashcards to better memorize vocabulary.

As you can see, studying pretty much boils down to learning vocabulary and grammar. This is very important. We can't have immersion without study, but we also cannot have study without immersion, as we want to be able to get meaning from our immersion and see how what we've studied applies to real language.

Immersion usually consists of whatever a native speaker of that language would read or watch. For example a Japanese YouTube video, or an anime, or a book, or a forum post, or even social media, etc.

## 1.7 Stages of learning

Language learning is a long-term endeavor. It should be noted that your experience as a beginner getting into the language will differ greatly from an intermediate or advanced learner. The process does not change between intermediate and advanced learners since they've already gotten past the initial hurdle. This guide will steer you through the labyrinthine beginner stage, and then from the intermediate stage onwards.

## 2.1 How to learn Japanese

The learning process for the beginner consists of:

1. Learning the *hiragana* and *katakana*, which are two of the writing systems of Japanese. They are kind of like alphabets. You will study them on a recommended website after watching a YouTube video on them.
2. Learning basic vocabulary and their kanji with a software called *Anki*.
3. Learning grammar through a YouTube playlist.
4. Starting immersion with easy content and with high repetition. This is how you will be spending most of your time.

## 2.2 #Hiragana# and #Katakana# 
![Hiragana and Katakana](img/kana3.png)  
#Hiragana# and #katakana# are two components of the Japanese writing system (the third one being #kanji#). They are collectively referred to as the #kana#.

The Japanese writing system is better described as a syllabary rather than an alphabet. In fact, it's incorrect to call #hiragana# and #katakana# alphabets, as each character represents an entire syllable instead of a single letter. For example, the symbol「か」is pronounced as [ka].

### Hiragana 
<figure>
  <img src="/img/hiragana.png" />
  <figcaption>An example of a couple #hiragana#. This isn't a comprehensive chart.</figcaption>
</figure> 
#Hiragana# can be thought of as the "main alphabet" of Japanese. It's used for grammatical elements, in words of Japanese origin, for words that aren't usually written in #kanji#, and sometimes given names. It's the curlier and cutesy variant of #kana#.

### Katakana

![Katakana](img/katakana.png)
#Katakana# is the sharper and more angular version of #kana#. Each #katakana# symbol mirrors a #hiragana# counterpart which shares the same pronunciation. This variant of #kana# is used in loan words (words borrowed from other languages like English), onomatopoeia (Japanese is full of these!), and slang. It may also be used in names, mainly foreign names.

### How you are going to learn the #Kana#

#### Step 1 - the chart

First, I want you to take a good look at this #kana# chart:

![Hiragana and Katakana full chart](img/hiragana_katakana_LARGE.png)

Download image</a>

This chart will come in really handy while you're learning to read #kana#. I recommend you download it.

#### Step 2 - the YouTube video

<h3> <a href="https://youtu.be/_wZHqOghvSs" target="_blank">Watch this YouTube video</a> </h3><br>
It's a 2 hour long video about hiragana and katakana. It is a great introduction into the kana.  


#### Step 3 - the grinding

<h3><a href="https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana" target="_blank">The kana grinding game</a></h3><br>

<h4>How to play</h4>
1. Click "show/hide options"
2. Click "check all" for Hiragana
3. Start guessing how the hiragana are *pronounced*
4. Repeat until confident (may take a few days or weeks), and then do the same thing but with all "Hiragana combinations" also checked.
5. Repeat until confident, then do it with all "Katakana" also checked, and then with all "Katakana combinations" also checked.

#### Step 4 - reading practice

What also helps immensely in memorising the kana is reading sentences in kana.   
Not everything in Japanese is written in kana, and you will have trouble trying to read most things at this point without *kanji* knowledge, but sometimes in Japanese, kana is put over kanji to help you read. This is known as furigana. An example can be seen here! <ruby>
  日本語<rp>(</rp><rt>にほんご</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>. This just means the Japanese language (nihongo). I wrote it in its kanji form and put hiragana over it.

I recommend practicing your kana by trying to read some Tadoku graded readers, which you can find [here](https://tadoku.org/japanese/free-books/#l0)  

<strong><h3>You do not need to be able to understand anything.</h3></strong><br>

This is for consolidating your kana knowledge.
